A **web browser** is an [application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") for accessing [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website"). When a [user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing) "User (computing)") requests a [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page") from a particular website, the browser retrieves its [files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file") from a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") and then displays the page on the user's screen.

# [WEB CRAWLER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebCrawler)
**WebCrawler** is a [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine "Search engine"), and one of the oldest surviving search engines on the web today. For many years, it operated as a [metasearch engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine "Metasearch engine"). WebCrawler was the first web search engine to provide full text search.

# [REVERSE PROXY SERVER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)
In [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), a **reverse proxy** or surrogate server is a [proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server "Proxy server") that appears to any [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Clientâ€“server model") to be an ordinary [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server"), but in reality merely acts as an intermediary that forwards the client's requests to one or more ordinary web servers.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy#cite_note-apache-forward-reverse-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy#cite_note-2) Reverse proxies help increase scalability, performance, resilience, and security, but they also carry a number of risks.
